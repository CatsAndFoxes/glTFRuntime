# Features

* Allows to load Static Meshes, Skeletal Meshes, Animations, Hierarchies, Materials and Textures from glTF 2.0 Embedded files.
* Assets can be loaded on the fly both in PIE and Packaged Games.
* Assets can be loaded from the filesystem, http servers or raw json strings.
* Supports generating ad-hoc Skeletons or reusing already existing ones (a gltf Exporter for Skeletons is included too)
* Non skeletons/skins-related animations are exposed as Curves.
* Full support for PBR Materials
* Support for glTF 2.0 Sparse Accessors
* Support for multiple texture coordinates/channels/uvs
* Allows to define Static Meshes collisions (Spheres, Boxes, Complex Meshes) at runtime.

# Quickstart

Consider buying the plugin from the Epic Marketplace, you will get automatic installation and you will support the project.

If you want to build from sources, just start with a C++ project, and clone the master branch into the Plugins/ directory of your project, regenerate the solution files and rebuild the project.

Once the plugin is enabled you will get 3 new main C++/Blueprint functions:

![MainFunctions](Docs/Screenshots/MainFunctions.PNG?raw=true "MainFunctions")

Let's start with remote asset loading (we will use the official glTF 2.0 samples), open your level blueprint and on the BeginPlay Event, trigger
the runtime asset loading:

![UrlDuck](Docs/Screenshots/UrlDuck.PNG?raw=true "UrlDuck")

A bunch of notes:

* We are loading the asset from the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/master/2.0/Duck/glTF-Embedded/Duck.gltf url
* The glTFRuntimeAssetActor is a ready-to-use Actor class included in the plugin. It is perfect for testing, but you are encouraged to implement more advanced structures.
* The glTFLoadAssetFromUrl function is an asynchronous one, the related event will be triggered when the asset is loaded.
* The glTFRuntimeAssetActor requires a glTFRuntimeAsset to correctly spawn.

If all goes well you should see the Collada Duck:

# Loading Scenes

Time to run your favourite DCC to create a glTF file.

Here i am using Blender 2.83, and i will create a simple scene with Suzanne and a Hat (well a cone) on the center:

(you can download the asset from here if you do not want to build it by yourself:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdeioris/glTFRuntime/master/Docs/Assets/SuzanneWithHat.gltf)

<img src="Docs/Screenshots/SuzanneWithHat.PNG?raw=true" alt="SuzanneWithHat" width="50%" />

Now select both Suzanne and the Cone/Hat and select the File/Export/glTF2.0 menu option

In the export dialog ensure to select the gltf 2.0 Embedded format and to include the selected objects:

<img src="Docs/Screenshots/BlenderExport.PNG?raw=true" alt="BlenderExport" width="50%"/>

Now back to the Level Blueprint:

![LoadSuzanneWithHat](Docs/Screenshots/LoadSuzanneWithHat.PNG?raw=true "LoadSuzanneWithHat")

Notes:

* This time, as we are loading from the filesystem, we have a synchronous function.
* Note the transform with the increased Z value (if you get suzanne below the floor, you now know why it is happening ;)

The result:

<img src="Docs/Screenshots/RunSuzanneWithHat.PNG?raw=true" alt="RunSuzanneWithHat" width="50%"/>

By running the project in PIE, you will be able to see the hierarchy generated by the glTFRuntimeAssetActor:

![DetailsTree](Docs/Screenshots/DetailsTree.PNG?raw=true "DetailsTree")

This is managed automatically by the glTFRUntimeAssetActor implementation, but you are free to manipulate the glTF hierarchy as you need (included completely ignoring it)

# Loading Static Meshes

Til now, we have used the glTFRuntimeAssetActor commodity class for loading and showing our glTF Assets.

To get the best from the Plugin, you have access to lower level functions allowing you to load specific assets from the glTF scene.

In the following example we will load a single StaticMesh (the Suzanne part of the previous asset, without the Hat) and we will assign it to an already existent
StaticMesh actor in the scene (i have dragged a classic Cube here):

![LoadStaticMesh](Docs/Screenshots/LoadStaticMesh.PNG?raw=true "LoadStaticMesh")

The LoadStaticMesh function expects the index of a mesh into the glTF file. We are lucky as we know the index 0 is Suzanne, but you can load StaticMeshes by name too (the same name you set in Blender):

![LoadStaticMeshByName](Docs/Screenshots/LoadStaticMeshByName.PNG?raw=true "LoadStaticMeshByName")

Notes:

* As we are reusing an already configured StaticMesh Actor, Suzanne will inherit the previously set material slot
* If you change Suzanne with 'Cone', you will get the Cone mesh (obviously) but without the transform applied (read: no rotation, no scale, no translation), transforms are set into the glTF Node (more on nodes traversing later)
